# Chains

`new_llm_chain(model, prompt, output_key)` creates a completion chain from a
`llms.CompletionModel` and a `prompts.StringTemplate`. Its `input_keys()` come
from the template. Set `memory_store` before calling the chain to load and save
conversation state through `chains.call`.

`new_sequential_chain(children, input_keys, output_keys)` validates the key flow
between ordered child chains. Each child receives the original inputs and all
values produced by earlier children. The result contains only the selected
output keys.

The chain uses default `llms.CallOptions`. Change `options` before execution to
set provider-neutral controls. The broader LangChainGo chain family remains
tracked in the parity ledger.
